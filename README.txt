README.txt

The goal of the present simulation is to implement 
a model published by Epstein & Marder (1990) and 
check the accuracy of SNNAP by comparing SNNAP-
generated results with previously published results.

This subdirectory contains a model originally published
by:

Epstein, I.R. and Marder, E. (1990)  Multiple modes of a 
conditional neural oscillator.  Biol. Cybern.  63: 25-34.

The present model corresponds to the "Model N" of 
Epstein and Marder (1990). The components of the
modeled bursting neuron are illustrated in
Epstein_neu.jpg.  The default simulation is
similar to Fig. 5 of Epstein and Marder (1990).

The results of the SNNAP simulation are illustrated in
